Title: _ Get webpage source through a simple api call
Description: Nothing fancy about this, it simply retrieves the source of the
url you specify. The best part about this code, is you don't need to add any 
controls to your code. you just drop in the module, and call one function

[some string]=GetURLSource("http://[some url]")
It's simple and lightweight,
and with a little creativity, you could add features like daily news headlines,
todays weather forecast, or stock prices to your projects.
If you'e got any
questions, feel free to send me a message.
